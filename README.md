Analyzing factors impacting number of streams on Spotify using Python



The project included running all the major tests starting from data cleaning and analysis including: Descriptive analysis of data, checking for heterskedaticity and outliers; finding the right factors that impact maximum number of spotofy streams using BorutaShap and Mallow CP, and then conducting k-cross validation to validate that data is trained and then tested to check if model is giving right predictions or not.

After running OLS regression and validating its results, we can conclude that top 4 predictors found were 'in_spotify_playlists', 'in_apple_playlists', 'in_deezer_charts', 'in_deezer_playlists' that affected the number of times a song is streamed
